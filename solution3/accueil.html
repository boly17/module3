                    <h2>Chicken</h2>
                    Chicken refers to a young poultry of the subspecies Gallus gallus domesticus. A small male chicken is called a cockerel, while a female chicken is a pullet. A capon is a young rooster castrated so that its flesh becomes more tender, while a pullet whose ovaries have been removed - for the same purpose - is called a chicken.
                    They only made it halfway when they met Goosey Loosey. Goosey Loosey asked, "Hey, what's the matter? You look stressed!" Ducky l Daddles explained the whole incident to the Goosey Loosey.
                     Goosey Loosey thought that they would be needing some protection as the King's castle was quite far, And so, the four friends traveled to the castle.
                     They spread the news where they traveled. They traveled over the river, through the woods, passed grandmother's house, and all the way to the King's castle.
                    When they got there, the King was very surprised to see them. "What are all of you doing here?" the King asked. They told the King, "The world is ending!"
                     They revised the complete incident in front of the King as proof. But, the King wanted to see the piece of the sky they were talking about. But Chicken Little didn't have it.
                    "How can you say that it was a piece of sky?" Also read, The Magic Porridge Pot Story.
                    Chicken belongs to the gallinaceae family. It is a young breeding hen, male or female, which is slaughtered between seven and twelve weeks of age. In France, there is no chicken raised "in battery", that is to say in cages, intended for consumption. There are, however, several types of chicken farming, which have an influence on its quality.
Some chickens are slaughtered very young, after about forty-five days, and they weigh an average of 1 kilo. "Grain-fed" chicken, also called "branded" chicken, is raised "en parquet", that is to say locked up, and slaughtered between fifty and seventy days.
Of a superior quality, the chicken raised "on the course", that is to say in freedom, is slaughtered after one hundred and ten or one hundred and twenty days. This last mode of breeding gives chickens weighing about 2 kilos.
To guarantee a superior quality of chicken, the "Label Rouge", approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, guarantees free-range farming and a longer duration than that of a standard product. These chickens are also exclusively fed with plants, vitamins and minerals, including a minimum of 75% cereals.
In France, the reference in terms of quality remains Bresse chicken. It is the only one to benefit from an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC). This one is raised in the open air and benefits from a space of at least 10 m² per chicken. The quality of its feed also sets it apart from other chickens.
                    Food is the general word: Breakfast foods have become very popular. Many animals prefer grass as food.
                     Fare refers to the whole range of foods that may nourish a person or animal: an extensive bill of fare. The fare of some animals is limited in range.
                    How can you say that it was a piece of sky? It could be anything!" concluded the King. Chicken Little replied, "There was nothing above me except for the tree, and there was nothing on the ground when I got hit and I always have answers for everything.
                     So, the only thing above me was the sky." The King was not ready to agree with them. And so, the King traveled back with Chicken Little to take a look at the tree under which she was sitting that day.
                    They waited around for a while when a squirrel came running by and yelled down to them, "Hey guys, did you see my acorn I dropped yesterday?" All of them started to investigate.
                     And finally, when Chicken Little checked the hole inside the tree, she saw a missing acorn The squirrel was happy. Chicken Little was happy.
                    Chicken Little learned that the sky was not falling and that sometimes it's okay to not know all of the answers.
                    Here is a visual depiction of, "Chicken Little Story". Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens. In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day. Some hen breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year, with the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days.
                     After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable. Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years.
                    In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as 'soup hens'. In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted rather than being slaughtered to re-invigorate egg-laying.
                     This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7–14 days or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%, or up to 28 days under experimental conditions.
                     This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers but also re-invigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be force-moulted several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US. 
                      A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two cocks known as gamecocks. This term, denoting a cock kept for game, sport, pastime or entertainment, appears in 1646, after "cock of the game" used by George Wilson in the earliest known book on the secular sport, The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting of 1607.
                     Gamecocks are not typical farm chickens. The cocks are specially bred and trained for increased stamina and strength. The comb and wattle are removed from a young gamecock because if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match. This process is called dubbing. Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their blood, which increases their chances of winning.
                     Cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some but an example of animal cruelty by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries. Usually wagers are made on the outcome of the match, with the survivor or last bird standing declared winner.
                      Cocks possess congenital aggression toward other cocks to contest for females. Studies suggest that cockfights have existed even up to the Indus Valley civilisation as a pastime. Today it is commonly associated with religious worship, pastime, and gambling in Asian and some South American countries.
                     While not all fights are to the death, most use metal spurs as a weapon attached above or below the chicken's own spur, which typically results in death in one or both cocks. If chickens are in practice, owners place gloves on the spurs to prevent injuries.

                    <h2>Sushy</h2>
                    For a long time, sushi was considered exotic, and maybe a little scary. But now you can find it practically everywhere, even in the grocery store. But what are all the different kinds of sushi?
                    Sushi is a Japanese dish featuring specially prepared rice and usually some type of fish or seafood, often raw, but sometimes cooked.       
                    And though you might automatically associate the word sushi with raw fish, it's actually the rice that is the most important ingredient. Indeed, the word "sushi" refers to the sour flavor of the vinegared rice. Regardless of the toppings or fillings, sushi always includes rice.
                    As a matter of fact, sushi rice is so important that sushi chefs in Japan undergo years of training just to learn how to cook the rice properly, before they ever begin to handle any fish or seafood. 
                    Sushi rice is a medium-grained white rice prepared with vinegar and other seasonings such as salt and sugar. The usual variety of rice used for sushi is Japonica; in particular, the Koshihikari cultivar.
                    Japonica is a medium-grained rice with somewhat rounded grains, which makes it noticeably different from the skinnier, long-grained rice that we're used to in the West, which is known as indica rice. Japonica rice is starchy, with higher levels of a starch called amylopectin than indica rice.
                    This extra starch causes it to cook up fairly sticky, which makes it easier to eat with chopsticks, and is ideal for molding it together to make sushi.
